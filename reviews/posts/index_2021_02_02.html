    <p>Modification of Vision Transformer that makes use of grouped patches that share similarities in feature space.</p>

    <h2>Bilateral Local Attention Block</h2>
    <p><img src="/assets/reviews/boat/attention.png" alt="Bilateral Local Attention Block"/></p>

    <p>Image-space Local Attention (ISLA), or ISLA for short, computes self-attention among tokens from the same local window. Patches within the same local window are likely to be closely related to each other.</p>
    <p>To make use of information dropped by ISLA, Feature-Space Local Attention (FSLA) is introduced. Token features are grouped using balanced hierarchical clustering, and FSLA computes self-attention among tokens that are close in feature space.</p>

    <h2>Experiments</h2>
    <p>Slightly increased number of parameters leads to accuracy improvements of SWIN and CSWin models for main computer vision tasks (classification, segmentation, object detection).</p>
    <p>The neural network is composed of 3 hidden layers. The first layer has 32 neurons, while the second layer has 8, the third layer has 4 neurons. Such simple models can be efficiently trained using SGD and they are not so susceptible to overfitting.</p>
